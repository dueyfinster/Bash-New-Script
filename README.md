Bash-New-Script
===============

Script to generate a new Bash Script. Original by [William Shotts][].

I added:

+ Nice logging with colours
+ Extra command line options (verbose, quiet, debug) as default
+ Ability to log to a file (and strip colours)
+ Ability to source a configuration file (if it exists)
+ and other miscelleanous things useful to me!
